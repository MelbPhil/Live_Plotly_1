# Live_Plotly_1

## Overview of Live_Plotly_1
In this assignment, I learned how to graph data in JavaScript, using functions and Plotly! I created a webpage to showcase the results of a pretty creative scientific study. Read on to learn more.

## Results
I created a site where you can select the ID number of the study participant via a dropdown menu. After selecting the person, the data in the Bar, Gauge, and Bubble charts will change according to the participants results.

The data represented here showcases the bacteria that was found in ther person's belly button, and the gague is a meter of how frequently the person washes themselves.

## Summary
Although the data used to create this site is not particularly my favorite.. This is an excellent feet of manipulating data and creating my very own website to showcase the data results. The site is LIVE, and you can visit it with the following link: https://melbphil.github.io/Live_Plotly_1/
